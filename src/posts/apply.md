At valgrind, we pride ourselves in being thorough with applications and selection. This isn't the entire application process - you may be subject to further tests of your skills before fully joining the team.

> Please don't email/DM random members of valgrind regarding applications or joining the team. Pretty please.

Since we're an international team, we don't want to discriminate based on knowledge of English. However, use of ChatGPT to improve the quality of your application significantly lessens the chance that you are accepted, as any use of LLMs can be constituted as not filling out this form yourself - and we want to hear from *you*, not AI.
